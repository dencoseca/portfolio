                <p className="content__description">
                  Bragazzi's is a traditional Italian cafe, delicatessen and
                  shop. It's deeply set in its community and has a very
                  particular feel and atmosphere. It needed a marketing website
                  to root their online presence and show their personality. The
                  site needed to update business information based on Google
                  Business Data so the client could keep using the interface he
                  was familiar with. I wanted the website to get the most out of
                  the beautiful photography we had available. Gatsby's Static
                  Image component and its blazing fast serving of static sites
                  were key in delivering this and made it an obvious choice. And
                  if the air pressure is just right, it gets 100 across the
                  board on lighthouse! Yay!

                  Recipe Costings is an app that, wait for it... costs recipes!
                  An internal app for catering / service companies to get their
                  staff involved in the creative process. Employees can create
                  recipes and collaborate with each other using a database of
                  existing stock items. Built with Express using EJS to serve
                  the HTML with the data stored on MongoDB. This was a great way
                  for me to learn RESTful routing techniques and the backend
                  side of the MERN stack.

                <p className="content__description">
                  Something I use a lot are task management apps. Making one of
                  my own let me get to grips with connecting a front end with a
                  backend API using the full MERN stack. Building both from
                  scratch and managing data validation and pending server
                  requests really helped me see the kinds of design decisions
                  that become clear when developing full-stack apps. How and
                  where state is stored, calling only the data needed to reduce
                  network usage, and a million other decisions! My other goal
                  was to break away from using bootstrap and try a different CSS
                  framework. Workflow's CSS is built with Bulma and minimal
                  custom styling.

                  Alexa documents her overland travels with beautiful
                  photographs. She needed somewhere to showcase the pictures she
                  takes for her friends, family and anyone else interested in
                  travel and exploration. The focus here is on simplicity, and
                  giving the full stage to the stunning landscapes she captures.
                  Creating a custom WordPress theme enabled me to have the
                  control I wanted over the structure and styling while allowing
                  Alexa to create galleries and manage image uploads herself. I
                  have plans to rebuild this site using Gatsby, graphql and a
                  headless CMS.

                  Because apparently my emotional growth stopped in 1998. This
                  is something I wish I had back in the day! This was my first
